Last update: March 5, 2025


This dataset contains seven county-level indicators capturing different features of historically close-knit communities, focusing on in-group identity, in-group preference, norms tightness, and kinship tightness, for 1850-1940, harmonized for county borders of 1850, developed and used in Raz (2025):

1.	In-Group Identity: Local Name Index (LNI)
2.	In-Group Bias: Intra-Community Marriage (ICM)
3.	Cultural Tightness, familial norms: Tight Norms Index (TNI)
4.	Cultural Tightness, religious identities: Religious Homogeneity Index (RHI)
5.	Kinship Tightness: Strength of Family Ties Index (SFTI)
6.	Kinship Tightness: Median Kinship Propinquity (MKP), following Nelson (2020)
7.	Kinship Tightness: Kinship Propinquity Rate (KPR), following Nelson (2020)

Further details on each of the indicators in the next pages.

Different versions of the indicators are computed, using different population samples: (i) only White native-born population (VARNAME_WhiteNative); (ii) only White population (VARNAME_White); (iii) only native-born population (VARNAME_Native); (iv) no restrictions. 

The data can be download for contemporaneous counties, or harmonized for county borders of a particular decade (1850-2000), using the procedure in Hornbeck (2010).
