This dataset contains seven county-level indicators capturing different features of historically close-knit communities, focusing on in-group identity, in-group preference, norms tightness, and kinship tightness, for 1850-1940, developed and used in Raz (2025):

1.	<b>In-Group Identity</b>: <i>Local Name Index</i> (LNI)
2.	<b>In-Group Bias</b>: <i>Intra-Community Marriage</i> (ICM)
3.	<b>Cultural Tightness, familial norms</b>: <i>Tight Norms Index</i> (TNI)
4.	<b>Cultural Tightness, religious identities</b>: <i>Religious Homogeneity Index</i> (RHI)
5.	<b>Kinship Tightness</b>: <i>Strength of Family Ties Index</i> (SFTI)
6.	<b>Kinship Tightness</b>: <i>Median Kinship Propinquity</i> (MKP), following Nelson (2020)
7.	<b>Kinship Tightness</b>: <i>Kinship Propinquity Rate</i> (KPR), following Nelson (2020)

Further details on each of the indicators in the next pages.

Different versions of the indicators are computed, using different population samples: (i) only White native-born population (VARNAME_WhiteNative); (ii) only White population (VARNAME_White); (iii) only native-born population (VARNAME_Native); (iv) no restrictions. 

The data can be download for contemporaneous counties, or harmonized for county borders of a particular decade (1850-2000), using the procedure in Hornbeck (2010).
